    * MAJOR CHANGE: replace exRE with uses regular expressions 
        with something using wildcards

2015-12-19
    * url for SHA standard was wrong, edited in README.md but not in
        index.md; link to xlattice_go was also wrong; and a link to
        'gibhub'

2015-09-25
    * -V doesn't display anything                                       * FIXED
    * explanation of -i/--inDir is incorrect

2015-09-08
    * URGENT: tests should cover the executable, merkleize
    * document the package API as well as the command line
    * docs should include example of 

2015-08-01
    * flip hash and filename to match NLHTree, stepping to v6.0.0
    * should be able to read v5.0.0 files (hash first) but write 
        v6.0.0 files (filename first)
2015-08-01 (edited from -05-05)
    * need tests to verify that exclusions and matchList work as 
        expected

2105-07-13 (edited from -07-09)
    * major change: replace CRLF with LF                                * DONE
    * major change:                                                     * DONE
        - indent variable should be number of spaces                    * DONE
        - use xlattice.crypto SP as space cache, as in NLHTree          * DONE
        - drop deltaIndent (or rather make it a single space)           * DONE
    * major change: rework to use NLHTree                               * SKIP
        - This doesn't quite make sense.  The merkletree adds a         * SKIP
            directory level hash; there is no provision in an NLHTree   * SKIP
            for such a hash.                                            * SKIP

2015-07-09
    * correct errors in current build                                   * DONE
        - then bump to 5.0.0                                            * DONE
    * actually drop sha1File and sha256File, which are deprecated       * DONE

2015-05-22
    * investigate why {FIRST,OTHER}_LINE_RE2 containt XYZ at 
        beginning of pattern

2015-05-19
    * urgently need constructor from nested lists 
        and tests
2015-05-02
    * in the process, reorder the code to make structure more obvious
    * XXX MerkleDoc.__init__(): binding not handled
    * very delicate: MerkleDoc.createFromStringArray() tests on hash
        length (==20) to determine whether usingSHA1
        - should be symbolic constant
        - should raise exception if neither 20 nor 32
    * needs clarification: original code has bind(), bound(), path()
        as methods of MerkleNode class
2015-04-30
    * testMerkleTree needs to be modified to test different values of 
        deltaIndent
    * add option -b to display hashes base64

    * FIX: in its current form, software just blows up if an 
        unexpected character is found in a file name
        - in general, need to handle any reasonable unicode name
        - should display error message rather than just panicking
2014-12-15
    * tests that write files should verify that file doesn't exist
        before trying to create
    * need to update github; have fixed several typos
    * bring documentation up to vmmgr/__init__.py level
2014-06-24
    * NEED TO REVIEW: any use of self. in a static method is an error
    * add tests of createFromFile() to testMerkleTree.py                

2014-06-21
    * review code, dropping debug statements unless warranted
    * search for 'tests at the binary level', which appears to have
        been an elementary error (comparison of address instead of
        value)
        - the question is whether equal values are being tested -- or 
            identical values
    * MerkleDoc.createFromFileSystem() claims to return a MerkleTree
        but actually returns a MerkleDoc containging the tree
        - the doc appears to contain an extra line at the beginning
            which contains the absolute path of the document and a
            separate hash.
2014-06-18
    * FIX: if the argument following the -i option, a directory name, 
        has a trailing slash ('/'), it returns a runtime error.  
        Remember that the directory name may be just '/'.

2012-01-28 
    * -M option must be able to write .merkle files into a shadow
        directory structure (see 2011-07-26)

2011-08-08 
    * merkleize needs to be able to return doc (not just MerkleTree)
    * indentation appears to be wrong if eg -i /usr/local/src/py

2011-07-26 
    * need -M, which writes .merkle files in each directory

2011-07-25 i
    * after using MerkleTree hash, set ptr to zero to ease GC

2011-07-24 
    * MerkleTree.bind() is STUBBED
    * MerkleTree.equals() is STUBBED, needs recursion

2011-07-16 
    * FIX: merkleize can't handle top level directory such as /upages

2011-07-13 
    * MerkleTree constructor should not allow null exRE
    * review code for missing try blocks, other obvious sloppy work
    * add unit tests to source distribution
    * add svn ignores for build/*, dist/*, tmp/* possibly others
