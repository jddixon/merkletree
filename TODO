    * 20,32 replaced with SHA{1,2}_BIN_LEN, respectively                * DONE
2015-05-13
    * consider modigying relevant code so that hash for empty files     * DONE
        is SHA1_NONE or SHA2_NONE as appropriate                        * DONE
        - will introduce a conflict with sha1sum                        * FALSE
2015-05-12
    * MerkelTree.parseFirstLine (about line 484) calculates indent      * FIXED
        incorrectly                                                     * FIXED
    * MerkleTree.createFromStringArray() about line 533 calculated      * FIXED
        usingSHA1 incorrectly (tested on length of hash being 40)       * FIXED

2015-05-05
    * merkleize needs exclusions and matchList as lists; modify         * DONE
        merkleize accordingly (-X and -P add to lists)                  * DONE
    * need tests to verify that these work as expected
    * merkeltree listings should include empty files with null hash     * DONE

2015-05-02
    * restructure code as necessary to correct inheritance (that is,    * DONE
        make MerkleNode an abstract class and have Merkle{Doc,Tree,Leaf}* DONE
        subclass it)                                                    * DONE
    * in the process, reorder the code to make structure more obvious
    * XXX MerkleDoc.__init__(): binding not handled
    * very delicate: MerkleDoc.createFromStringArray() tests on hash
        length (==20) to determine whether usingSHA1
        - should be symbolic constant
        - should raise exception if neither 20 nor 32
    * needs clarification: original code has bind(), bound(), path()
        as methods of MerkleNode class

2015-04-30
    * testMerkleTree needs to be modified to test different values of 
        deltaIndent
    * add option -b to display hashes base64

    * FIX: in its current form, software just blows up if an 
        unexpected character is found in a file name
        - in general, need to handle any reasonable unicode name
        - should display error message rather than just panicking
2014-12-15
    * tests that write files should verify that file doesn't exist
        before trying to create
    * need to update github; have fixed several typos
    * bring documentation up to vmmgr/__init__.py level
2014-06-24
    * NEED TO REVIEW: any use of self. in a static method is an error
    * add tests of createFromFile() to testMerkleTree.py                

2014-06-21
    * review code, dropping debug statements unless warranted
    * search for 'tests at the binary level', which appears to have
        been an elementary error (comparison of address instead of
        value)
        - the question is whether equal values are being tested -- or 
            identical values
    * MerkleDoc.createFromFileSystem() claims to return a MerkleTree
        but actually returns a MerkleDoc containging the tree
        - the doc appears to contain an extra line at the beginning
            which contains the absolute path of the document and a
            separate hash.
2014-06-18
    * FIX: if the argument following the -i option, a directory name, 
        has a trailing slash ('/'), it returns a runtime error.  
        Remember that the directory name may be just '/'.

2012-01-28 
    * -M option must be able to write .merkle files into a shadow
        directory structure (see 2011-07-26)

2011-08-08 
    * merkleize needs to be able to return doc (not just MerkleTree)
    * indentation appears to be wrong if eg -i /usr/local/src/py

2011-07-26 
    * need -M, which writes .merkle files in each directory

2011-07-25 i
    * after using MerkleTree hash, set ptr to zero to ease GC

2011-07-24 
    * MerkleTree.bind() is STUBBED
    * MerkleTree.equals() is STUBBED, needs recursion

2011-07-16 
    * FIX: merkleize can't handle top level directory such as /upages

2011-07-13 
    * MerkleTree constructor should not allow null exRE
    * review code for missing try blocks, other obvious sloppy work
    * add unit tests to source distribution
    * add svn ignores for build/*, dist/*, tmp/* possibly others
