~/dev/py/merkletree/TODO

This package depends upon pysha3-0.2.1, which should be in /usr/local/src
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

2013-10-09
    * URGENT: usingSHA1 flag is collected in merkleize, but then ignored

2013-06-07
    * switch to argparse for parsing the command line

2013-06-05
    * dat.xlattice.org should either be dropped or should be added  # DONE
        to the github repository

2012-04-23
    * get rid of the ABCMetadata package

2012-01-28 
    * -M option must be able to write .merkle files into a shadow
        directory structure (see 20110726)

2011-08-08 
    * merkleize needs to be able to return doc (not just MerkleTree)
    * indentation appears to be wrong if eg -i /usr/local/src/py

2011-07-26 
    * need -M, which writes .merkle files in each directory

2011-07-25 i
    * after using MerkleTree hash, set ptr to zero to ease GC

2011-07-24 
    * MerkleTree.bind() is STUBBED
    * MerkleTree.equals() is STUBBED, needs recursion

2011-07-13 
    * MerkleTree constructor should not allow null exRE
    * review code for missing try blocks, other obvious sloppy work
    * add unit tests to source distribution
    * add svn ignores for build/*, dist/*, tmp/* possibly others
