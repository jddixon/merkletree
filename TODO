    * tests that write files should verify that file doesn't exist
        before trying to create
    * need to update github; have fixed several typos
    * bring documentation up to vmmgr/__init__.py level

2014-09-16
    * regex should accept ! in file names                               * DONE

2014-06-26
    * FIX: firstLineRE_{1,3}() should be MerkleTree function, not       * DONE
        MerkleDoc                                                       * DONE
    * FIX: MerkleTree.parseFirstLine is invoking the compiled regex     * DONE
        as a pattern (around line 523)                                  * DONE

2014-06-25
    * make FIRST_LINE_RE_1 and _3 public                                * DONE
    * these should be properties and so not assignable                  * DONE

2014-06-24
    * BUG in MerkleTree.createFromFile, line 675, use of                * FIXED
        self._usingSHA1                                                 * FIXED

    * NEED TO REVIEW: any use of self. in a static method is an error
    * another BUG in merkleTree.createFromFile, line 683                * FIXED
    * add tests of createFromFile() to testMerkleTree.py                

2014-06-21
    * review code, dropping debug statements unless warranted
    * search for 'tests at the binary level', which appears to have
        been an elementary error (comparison of address instead of
        value)
        - the question is whether equal values are being tested -- or 
            identical values
    * MerkleDoc.createFromFileSystem() claims to return a MerkleTree
        but actually returns a MerkleDoc containging the tree
        - the doc appears to contain an extra line at the beginning
            which contains the absolute path of the document and a
            separate hash.
2014-06-18
    * FIX: if the argument following the -i option, a directory name, 
        has a trailing slash ('/'), it returns a runtime error.  
        Remember that the directory name may be just '/'.

2013-10-09
    * URGENT: usingSHA1 flag collected in merkleize, but then ignored   * FIXED

2013-06-07
    * switch to argparse for parsing the command line

2013-06-05
    * dat.xlattice.org should either be dropped or should be added      * DONE
        to the github repository                                        * DONE

2012-04-23
    * get rid of the ABCMetadata package

2012-01-28 
    * -M option must be able to write .merkle files into a shadow
        directory structure (see 2011-07-26)

2011-10-27 
    * FIX: merklelib is producing tree files whose first line is        * FIXED
        indented by two spaces, which MerkleTree.createFromStringArray()* FIXED 
        cannot handle                                                   * FIXED

2011-08-08 
    * merkleize needs to be able to return doc (not just MerkleTree)
    * indentation appears to be wrong if eg -i /usr/local/src/py

2011-07-26 
    * need -M, which writes .merkle files in each directory

2011-07-25 i
    * after using MerkleTree hash, set ptr to zero to ease GC

2011-07-24 
    * MerkleTree.bind() is STUBBED
    * MerkleTree.equals() is STUBBED, needs recursion

2011-07-16 
    * FIX: merkleize can't handle top level directory such as /upages

2011-07-13 
    * MerkleTree constructor should not allow null exRE
    * review code for missing try blocks, other obvious sloppy work
    * add unit tests to source distribution
    * add svn ignores for build/*, dist/*, tmp/* possibly others
